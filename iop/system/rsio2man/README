Based on the free XSIO2MAN replacement module, freesio2.
Built from the sio2log source, without the logging feature.

This module is meant to be a compatible version of rom1:SIO2MAN,
	which is a newer version of SIO2MAN than rom0:SIO2MAN.
rom1:SIO2MAN is used by the DVD player, which is required for the remote control manager (RMMAN).
