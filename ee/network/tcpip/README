Playstation 2 port of the LWIP v1.4.1 protocol stack - 2012/12/24
-----------------------------------------------------------------

So why the change in the SMAP driver? I've changed the design so that the LWIP protocol stack doesn't have to be modified.

This network protocol stack has been written to work with the NETMAN Network Manager.

How to install this into your PS2SDK:
-------------------------------------
1. Download the correct version of LWIP from the LWIP homepage and extract the downloaded archive into the tcpip folder of your PS2SDKSRC folder (E.g. ps2sdksrc/common/tcpip/).
2. Place a copy of ps2ip141.h (Found within the include folder in this package) into the folder containing the compiler header files for the IOP (E.g. ps2sdk/ee/include).
2. Place a copy of tcpip141.h (Found within the include folder in this package) into the folder containing the common compiler header files (E.g. ps2sdk/common/include).
3. Build this library.

Good luck!
